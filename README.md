# OpenGLAVLC

A small OpenGL w/ SDL project for the Linear Algebra course of 2016.1 at UFPE (1st semester of freshman year). 

Implementation consists of:  
  - Simple 3D rendering through .obj reading w/ camera projection.
  - Manual implementation of linear transformation matrices (linear, not affine).
